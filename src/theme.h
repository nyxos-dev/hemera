/* ============================================================================
 * THE GUI palette — one place the desktop's colours live.
 *
 * Before this, every colour was an `fb_rgb(r,g,b)` literal scattered across
 * compositor.c and each *_win.c, so changing the accent meant hunting call
 * sites and there was no way to theme the desktop. Call sites now name a ROLE
 * (THEME_ACCENT, THEME_WINDOW_BG, …) and the value lives here.
 *
 * These are macros, not a const struct, because fb_rgb() is a runtime function
 * (kernel.h): each expands to a call where the drawing code already runs. That
 * also keeps this header a pure compile-time constant set — no initialisation
 * order to worry about — and leaves the door open for a future runtime theme
 * (Settings → accent) by swapping these for a table lookup without touching a
 * single call site.
 *
 * The accent is the brand PURPLE — the wallpaper's default "Morado"
 * {130,90,210}. Keep any new GUI colour as a role here, not a fresh literal.
 * ========================================================================== */

/* --- Brand accent (RUNTIME-THEMEABLE) ------------------------------------
 * The accent is the one colour the desktop rices on: a single /etc/nyx.conf
 * `accent = <name>` retints every title bar, the taskbar, the Start menu and the
 * tray pop-ups at once (v6.5.28). So THESE TWO are runtime variables, set by
 * apply_nyx_config() from the chosen accent colour; the default is the brand
 * purple "Morado" {130,90,210} — identical to the old constant, so an unconfigured
 * desktop is byte-for-byte unchanged. Every other role below stays a compile-time
 * macro; call sites are untouched (THEME_ACCENT still reads as a colour value). */
